##About 

For the Hack-Reactor engineering immersive program, I was given an assignment to create a minimum viable product in a limited timeframe of 2 days. This project is the outcome of that endeavor.

This project is a game recommendation platform that leverages RawgAPI to enable users to search for games they like. Users can like games and save them using MongoDB. The platform also utilizes OpenAI to generate recommendations based on the liked games.


Here's an example of authentication using passport.js. In this example, we are logging in using an account that was created earlier with the email address "test@gmail.com".

This is an example of authentication that prevents a user from logging in with an incorrect password.

The main page of the platform displays a list of games that users can browse through to find the ones they like. Once they find a game they like, they can like it and save it. Based on the liked games, the platform generates recommendations for the user.

This is the current lighthouse score
